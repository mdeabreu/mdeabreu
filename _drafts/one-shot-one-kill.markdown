Careful not to ruin my cloak, I set up a flag for the National army in the courtyard of a church in a small village. The rest of my team is busy capturing a guard post; so I move to a roadblock. I move quietly, stealthily, I know how important it is to capture this roadblock; if we can successfully capture it then no enemy reinforcements will be able to enter the village in the mountains. Finding a spot behind some sand bags I look down the road leading back to the church courtyard.

I stop and listen; the wind blows through my hair, the birds carry out conversations, very little sound pierces the thick humid air. Then I notice something, in my peripheral vision; an enemy infantry man lumbers slowly under the weight of his pack, slowly moving towards the courtyard.

I pick up my rifle. I chamber a piercing round, the sound echoes through the valley; if the enemy noticed, it was too late. The crack of thunder pierces the small village as the shot soars out of the barrel. A trail of steam following the path of my bullet forms as friction causes the water in the air to instantly boil, the path leads straight to what was once my adversaries head.

One shot. One kill.

He falls to his knees and then crumples to the ground. I don't know why we are meant to kill each other, why we are fighting this stupid war. I suppose we both just do as we are told; but all I know is that there is one less enemy, one less person trying to kill me...
