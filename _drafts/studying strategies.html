Currently many students are franticly studying for upcoming final exams, which made me think about how I study and how I take notes in class. While in class I will take notes on things I think are important but a lot of the time I may be slacking off: browsing Reddit, playing games, reading articles, or looking at other things I am interested at that point in time. As a result of this slacking off my notes suffer and when I need them (for studying for a final...) they aren't as complete as I would like them. Though, oddly enough, every now and then one lecture of my notes are really detailed and complete; that's when I remember that a friend was missing that lecture for one reason or another and so I opted to let them borrow my notes when they are back. Now, someone else will be looking at my notes so I strive to make them as nice, complete, and informative as possible to help out my friend as much as possible.

This brings me back to studying for finals. Most students need to get into the mindset that someone else will be reading their notes at a later date, namely, their future selves. While something may seem obvious at a given point in a lecture, it may not be so obvious if someone weren't in the lecture (like a sick friend) or someone who has forgotten the lecture like your future self. So for my next semester I'm going to try and take notes as if I will be publishing them for others to read, this way my notes will be as complete as possible. On top of that, I may actually publish them, I have been thinking about creating a small site for myself where I can publish my notes as I take them so that myself and others will have access to them at any time. Though that is a project for another day.
