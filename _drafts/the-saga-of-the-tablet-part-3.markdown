The Saga of the Tablet Part 3
Final chapter (hopefully)
While studying the rotation stopped working making it almost impossible to use so once again I had to phone Asus in hopes of getting it repaired or much more wanted, replaced.
I sent it in for repairs and before long I got an email stating that they were unable to replicate either the rotation on the touch screen issues I responded pleading with them to replace it and thankfully they agreed to replace it with a refurbished device.
Hopefully this is the end of the tale but I guess we will have to wait and see.
