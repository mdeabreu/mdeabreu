The Saga of the Tablet Part 1

Talk about Emma's Ipad and using the Jot note Pro to take notes in class for university. I decided to get a nexus 7 along with the same stylus so I can also take handwritten notes in class
Talk about how it wasn't working very well, thinking it was a problem with the stylus I phoned support and they sent me a replacement tip for the stylus unfortunately it didn't fix the problem so I phoned Asus support to fix the tablet, they replaced the logic board but the problem persisted.

Many moons ago, back in 2010 Apple announced their new device, the iPad. Initially, I thought it was a little silly; I thought it was an iPod touch that had a bad run in with a rolling pin. Though as the years went by I saw more and more people using them and I started wanting one myself until eventually my girlfriend Emma got one. We sat together playing around on it consuming media, watching videos, reading articles, and playing games. Then in one of my classes I saw someone using a stylus, the [Jot Pro](http://www.adonit.net/jot/pro/) and an app to take handwritten notes. I immediately thought this would be a great way to take notes, the benefits of handwritten notes plus the benefits of digital notes; something I have been interested in for a long time.

After looking into it a bit more, Emma decided that she wanted to try it as well with her iPad. After using the Jot Pro and an app we found on the AppStore she said it revolutionized how she does her school work. One day I decided to borrow her iPad and stylus to take notes for one day, and I absolutely loved it. I decided that I would get the same stylus but instead of an iPad I would get a [Google Nexus 7](http://google.com), little did I know this would be the beginning of an epic saga.

Immediately after purchasing the tablet I began experimenting with different apps to find one that worked well and was feature rich. The one I found, "Lecture Notes" had more than enough features and options; in fact it had so many it took a little while to at it set up correctly. It was during that time that I was getting a little frustrated because unlike the iPad it did not work out of the box, however with a little tweaking I get it working. It was only once I bought everything to class that I noticed some of the problems that would plague me.
