The Saga of the Tablet Part 1

Talk about Emma's Ipad and using the Jot note Pro to take notes in class for university. I decided to get a nexus 7 along with the same stylus so I can also take handwritten notes in class
Talk about how it wasn't working very well, thinking it was a problem with the stylus I phoned support and they sent me a replacement tip for the stylus unfortunately it didn't fix the problem so I phoned Asus support to fix the tablet, they replaced the logic board but the problem persisted.
