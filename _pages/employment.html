<h2>Safe Software Inc. - Development Intern</h2>
<h3>January 12 - August 24, 2012</h3>
<p>Over my entire career in computer science all of my experience has been theoretical and in an educational environment; however, having practical experience is a great way to further my knowledge and prepare myself for entering the work force. At SFU I joined the coop program where I would be matched up with a company looking to hire a part time developer, it is through the coop program that I was given a four month coop term with Safe Software Inc. It was an incredible experience and I was thrilled when they asked me to extend to an eight month term. It was an extraordinary experience and was wonderful to work with so many different people in such a helping and kind environment.</p>

<p>Safe is a company that specializes in Geographic Information System software, their flagship product is known as FME Workbench. This piece of software allows users to read and write data using over 240 different file formats and databases. It is possible to read from one format and write to an entirely different format; or even reading from multiple sources and combining the data into one output file. It is also possible users may wish to manipulate the data, this can be done using Transformers (from a selection of over 400) which can be combined in innumerable different ways. Overall it is quite an impressive piece of software that works behind the scenes for many different well known companies, websites and organizations.</p>

<p>In the first four months I was on a variety of different teams working on many different tasks and projects. Some of the teams I worked with included the XML team, the Integrations team, and the Database team; quite often I would be assigned a task from any team that required a bit of extra help even if that meant putting a my current projects temporarily on hold. A few of these projects included adding support for CityGML 2.0, expanding the Python API, and integrating several new Transformers created by some third party developers. Others included updating documentation for the many APIs, and adding a sample to create an installer for third-party plugins. One of the larger projects included creating a Java template for geodatabase company so that they could more easily create a database reader and writer. Near the end of the term I was asked if I would like to stay on and extend my work term by another four months, I eagerly said yes.</p>

<p>The second term was a bit more stable with less switching teams; this was namely due to the co-owner, Dale Lutz, taking an interest and assigning me several of his special projects. It was a great experience and a lot of fun to work so closely with someone so vested in the software. A few of these projects included adding in common SQL functions for several of the database formats that are supported by FME; these functions are displayed to the user in several of the Transformers and will make creating SQL queries easier for users. Another project was to upgrade our Shortest Path Finder transformer to allow users to find the shortest path between multiple points and multiple pairs of points; all of this while using the same input network. The last and one of the more interesting projects was to overhaul the user interface of one of the transformers to make it easier to use and understand for the user. This required learning a fair bit of Qt and adding a large number of helper functions throughout the codebase to make some of the functions available to all other programmers.</p>

<p>Overall it was an amazing experience that I will never forget, I had the pleasure to work with many extraordinarily helpful and dedicated individuals who absolutely loved their jobs. All these people worked together to create an incredible piece of software and an even better work environment. I wish them all the best of luck with upcoming release of FME 2013 and any future endeavours, if any of them are reading this thank you for all the help and amazing experiences.</p>
