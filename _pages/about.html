<p>Hello, my name is Matthew DeAbreu. I am a fourth year computing science student at <a href="http://www.sfu.ca">Simon Fraser University</a> in Burnaby, Canada. For the past several years I have been working hard towards my goal of entering the video games industry as a developer, I have recently had the opportunity to work as a development intern at <a href="http://www.safe.com">Safe Software Inc.</a> on their flagship product, FME, and have loved every moment of it.</p>

<p>I have had an interest in computers for as long as I can remember, the majourity of my skills have been self taught, however university has been invaluable for expanding my theoretical knowledge. I will continue to work towards completing my goal and plan on learning as possible along the way.</p>

<h1>Education</h1>
<p>Throughout my elementary school and early high school career I spent a lot of time working with computers attempting to understand how they worked and learning as much as possible. Most of the time this has been for my own benefit and purely out of interest; this attempts at expanding my knowledge usually took the form of creating websites, or small programs to learn an algorithm, and even creating small games. I would always attempt to understand the unknown and strive to expand my own knowledge.</p>

<p>During my last two years of high school I started formalizing my knowledge by taking some Information Technologies courses which improved my skills working with Flash, Photoshop, Javascript, HTML, C++ and Visual Basic. From there I started studying at SFU where I greatly expanded my knowledge and gained a theoretical knowledge about a wide variety of topics including the design and operation of an Operating System, the design and creation of a CPU, networking system, databases, cryptography and a number of algorithms and data structures.</p>

<h1>Interests</h1>
<p>I have a vested interest in computers in general but also in the hardware that comprises the black or beige tower that we often pay so little attention. Some of my other interests include the user interface and how to make computers as accessible as possible but still retain the power more advanced users crave without cluttering the interface. Networking and how computers talk to each other is yet another interest, along with security and how we can protect ourselves online.</p>

<p>Some of my other less digital interests include photography, trying to get that perfect picture of a silhouette in front of a fiery red sky just as the sun sets. Going skiing with friends, feeling the wind go by and the snow underfoot as we race down a mountain; and mountain biking is another great way to spend a beautiful day with some friends.</p>
