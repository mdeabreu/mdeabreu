Now that everyone and their grandma has a smartphone, Twitter, Facebook and most likely a blog; I'd be very curious to see how the length of sentences has changed over the past few years. Normally when I'm writing a report, essay, or a story I base the length of a sentence on the width of a page. In Word (or Open Office or Libre Office, etc) you can very clearly see the size of a page and how long your sentence is relative to that. I would always try to make them between two and three lines long but ever since I've started writing on my phone I've noticed that I can no longer tell if they are a proper length. On a smartphone most writing apps don't show you a page, instead they show you an area the width of the screen and so three lines on a smartphone is significantly shorter compared to a full fledged word processor. So as I said, I'd be very curious to see how sentence lengths have changed since the advent of social media and smartphones.
