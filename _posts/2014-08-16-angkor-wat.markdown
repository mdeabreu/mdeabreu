Going into Thailand we knew that our visa was only valid for 30 days so we knew that at some point we would have to leave the country and then re-enter to get another 30 days. We decided to make the best of this by leaving Thailand and going to Cambodia, specifically to Siem Reap where we could go to see Angkor Wat and the rest of the Angkor Heritage Site.

When we arrived in Siem Reap we got a taxi from the airport to our hotel, along the way our driver offered to be an exclusive driver for an entire day where he would take us to the many different temples within the heritage site that are too far to walk to (about 45 km from Angkor Wat) and that he would pick us up early in the morning to see sunrise over Angkor Wat. We agreed since he was a nice guy, we wanted to see the sunrise, and many people will rent a tuktuk or a taxi for a whole day.

The next morning we woke up painfully early but we knew we had to be out the door, the sunrise waits for no one! Turns out, there wasn't going to be a sunrise, it was overcast... Regardless we got to see Angkor from a distance and we decided to press on, there would be other days to explore Angkor Wat and we had other temples waiting for us!

Since we were so early leaving Angkor Wat we were one of the first people arriving at the outlying temples. We arrived at Banteay Srey and were the only ones there, we had the entire place to ourselves which just made the ancient ruins all the more interesting. We could see all the intricately detailed carvings, we could walk unobstructed wherever we wanted, and we could get a sense of how ancient this place was... While there I couldn't stop thinking about how old this city was and yet how detailed the carvings were. What would this place have been like almost a thousand years ago when it was in its prime? The three days we spent in the park had my mind filled with questions about what life was like, why these temples were built, why were they abandoned, and so many others...

On our second day in Angkor we did the Flight of the Gibbon, basically it is a series of ziplines going through the jungle high up in the trees. We had an absolute blast! This was the first time I did anything like this and it couldn't have been more amazing, we got a few photos and videos of Emma and I soaring through the treetops but unfortunately they are on Emma's camera so I will have to retrieve them at some point. Regardless it was an experience that I don't think I'll ever forget.

For our third and final day in Angkor we decided to go on a 30-40km bike ride through the park hitting up as many temples as we could. We started with Angkor Wat where we got a wonderful tour guide showing us and telling us all about the history and meanings of Angkor Wat. Interesting bit of trivia: the main path you walk along to get to Angkor Wat is bordered by two snakes with 7 heads, each head represents a colour and so the path is a rainbow road. Angkor Wat itself represents heaven; so you literally walk along the rainbow road to heaven!

One of the more amazing sights I saw was this absolutely massive tree growing on top of part of the temple. The tree is actually slowly destroying this part of the temple as its roots seek out water. What makes this so stunning in my mind is just thinking about how old this tree must be so that it could grow to such immense heights, and to think that the temple is even older! It had to be abandoned in order for the tree to start growing! This is just one of many examples that helps to solidify in your mind just how **old** this place is... Truly mind boggling and absolutely stunning...
