Sorry for the long delay between posts, it has been a rather unfortunate week. First we left Chiang Mai in the evening taking an overnight sleeper train down to Bangkok and then transferred onto another train that would take us further south to Hua Hin. This second train ride was more than 4 hours long with no air conditioning, making it absolutely brutal. Once we arrived in Hua Hin we were exhausted and just collapsed in the cool comfort of our hotel room. The next day still feeling very drained from the train ride we planned on having a relaxing day at the beach, unfortunately our bodies had other plans as we both came down with food poisoning. We only really had one day in Hua Hin where we weren't cooped up in our hotel room and we got to enjoy the sun, the beach, and even did some swimming in the ocean; then food poisoning hit us again... We managed to get into fairly good condition and took a mini-bus to Pattaya, finally our vacation was back on track.

We are both feeling better, not perfect, but better. So now we have been able to enjoy ourselves and the beach side city of Pattaya. We've still been taking it easy but we have got walking on the beach, explored some of the city and have been slowly getting our energy back. We even learned how to use Songthaews correctly, normally we had been asking the driver to take us to a specific location and then we would haggle over price, doing it this way we were basically renting out the entire truck and using it as a personal taxi; the correct way is just to get into the back of the truck, now the driver will just drive on a preset route and whenever he goes somewhere we don't want we just hop off and pay him. Much cheaper.

Overall it's nice to have our vacation back on track, we still have a few more days in Pattaya to explore before we head up to Bangkok and stay in our first real hostel which will be a new and interesting experience.
