Over the past several months, my girlfriend Emma and I have been planning a backpacking trip to Thailand and today I have left to meet her in Australia where she has been on exchange with Murdoch University. Throughout my life I have had very little flying experience beyond the small puddle jumpers that are flown by WestJet within North America. Now however I get to fly in a brand new Boeing 787-8, more commonly known as a Dreamliner, and I have to say it is a dream.

It has all the staples of an aircraft, the sterilized air, the tiny seats, and the pouch filled with safety information and a magazine; but despite that the aircraft itself is quite nice. The overhead bins are quite large, there is a fair amount of foot room, and there is even a decent amount of space in the isles and the washrooms; ink addition to the space the cabin lights are a gentle blue color along with the light entering in through the windows giving the plane a nice relaxing feel to it. Where the flight becomes a dream however is how the crew and Japan Airlines treats their customers.

They are all extremely polite and willing to try and help in anyway possible; I have two backpacks with me, one with all my clothes and the other with all my electronics and other entertainment. Now normally I wouldn't mind checking the larger bag with all my clothes but I have a short layover in Singapore with another airline so I don't want to have to wait for my luggage before heading through customs, checking back in and then through security. If I could keep both bags with me as carry-ons I would be much less stressed, thankfully the employees said I could join priority boarding to ensure I could find a location for my bag. Once in the air the stewards came by with a drink and snack service; an hour later they came by with a choice of two hot meals, both of which came with potato salad, noodle salad, fruit salad, regular salad, the option of hot miso soup, green tea, and a choice of drink (including wine, sake, beer, etc) all of which was included with the ticket. Four hours in and I can safely say that so far this flight is very enjoyable.

PS: For the next two months I will be writing blog posts about my trip with the occasional set of photos. All of this will be written on a tablet so if there are any spelling mistakes please forgive me and feel free to use the comments or contact form to alert me. Thank you!

Edit: Actually I have one complaint, they are still using the double-pronged audio jack which means I can't plug in my own noise canceling in-ear headphones and have to use theirs which unfortunately sit on the ear and so they don't cancel out the sounds of the cabin very well.
