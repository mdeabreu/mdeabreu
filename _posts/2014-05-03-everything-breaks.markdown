Everything breaks. My family has an ongoing joke that the universe hates us and so if something **can** go wrong it **will** go wrong, also known as [Murphy's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law) but we call it DeAbreu's Law. As an extension to this we say that something is always broken, as soon as it is fixed something else will inevitably break. I recently had a huge run in with this and everything broke.

While studying for exams I'm usually at my desk with my desk lamp on, then of course the light burns out. Rather frustrating but nothing a quick shopping trip can't fix. So the next time I got a chance I went out and bought a new bulb; less than an hour after I fixed it my tablet broke. Normally when you rotate the device the screen rotates too, unfortunately that stopped working making the tablet extremely frustrating to use. So after a call with customer support I shipped that off to be repaired/replaced. That evening after shipping the tablet I went to copy some files from my brothers computer using an external hard drive, and wouldn't you know it... The drive isn't working. Doing some quick tests I find out that the drive is faulty and needs to be replaced.

When things go bad they go really bad, and when things break everything around them seems to break. In this case I was quite lucky that everything that broke was under warranty or easily replaced. I can see a similar situation in which everything is out of warranty which would be extremely frustrating, hopefully the universe doesn't get any ideas!
