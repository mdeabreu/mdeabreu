I mentioned in an earlier post that we had decided to stay longer in Chiang Mai, on of the reasons was so we would be able to visit the Sunday Market. This is a much larger version of the night bazaar we visited on our second day, we knew it was larger but when we got there we were just blown away.

The Sunday Market only starts at 4pm and really gets going at around 5, so to waste the day away we decided to visit yet another temple. This one happened to be called the silver temple because the entire thing is made out of silver, next to it there is a workshop were the many artists are tirelessly working away at creating new and beautiful pieces of silver.

Here you can see the entrance and some of the details that has been captured in the silver, its absolutely stunning.

An even closer look at some of the detail, this is the level of detail and quality of every piece of silver on the temple.

After some more walking and a bit of swimming at the hotel we returned to the city just in time for the market, here you can see a little glimpse of it. It was originally explained as taking up an entire street spanning almost a kilometer through the center of the city, when we got there we quickly learned it was much larger. Entire side streets were shut down and filled with tables, merchandize and people; it was a lot to take in. One of the more interesting things was that on all the telephone poles were speakers, and a little bit out of nowhere they started to play the Thailand national anthem causing every single person to stop. Thousands of bustling people became completely still and silent, it was extraordinary.

As I said the market starts at around 4 but it goes all the way until midnight and I feel like you would need all that time if you wanted to see everything. We spent 3 or 4 hours and I feel we barely scratched the surface. If you are ever in Chiang Mai I highly recommend you visit the Sunday Market, even if it's just for the experience.
