For the past four months Emma has been on exchange in Australia; many readers know this already but what you may not realize is just how many friends she has made and how close she has gotten to them. For the past couple of days now that everyone has finished exams it has been one event after another to release steam and relax, during these events I have met most of Emma's friends and learned just how amazing they all are. Two nights ago Emma and I hosted her last party with all of them; we invited them over to our apartment and we all played games, laughed, drank and ate every last scrap of food in the house.

We started off the evening with chips, crackers, wine, and cheese while playing a game of Never Have I Ever. Basically, we're all sitting in a circle and one at a time we say "Never have I ever..." and then an activity like bungee jumping or going to a night club; anyone in the circle who has done one of these things takes a sip of their drink. It's a great way to learn more about your friends.

A little later in the evening we brought out the main dishes, tacos and pizza! This was great because Emma and I were able to make our own salsa, lime and cilantro rice, various taco toppings, and two pizzas; all this food would have been thrown out anyways if it weren't eaten so being able to feed all our friends was awesome. In addition we made dessert which was a layer of coconut custard, a layer of raspberries, a layer of raspberry custard, a chocolate mousse and finally a meringue. Again this used up much of our food and it was absolutely delicious!

After dinner we split the group into two and played charades which was hilarious, each team made little slips of paper with people/movies/etc for a member of the other team to act out for their team. We had so much fun trying to come up with entertaining things for the other team to act out and even more watching them act it out.

All said and done it was a great evening filled with great friends, but like all evenings it had to come to an end. Like I said, Emma had become great friends with each and every single person in that room over the four months she spent in Australia and this was the final goodbye. I had known these people for less than two weeks and in that time small friendships grew, so if it was hard for me to say goodbye I can't believe how hard it must have been for Emma. Luckily with the use of technology the world is a far smaller place and so they are all able to keep in touch through the use of the internet and I believe they will. I doubt these friendships will fade.
