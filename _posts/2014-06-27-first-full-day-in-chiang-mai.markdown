We are now fully settled into life in Chiang Mai and so far it has been amazing; now I can finally take the time to write this and fill you all in on the first full day in Chiang Mai.

We woke up fairly early and decided to go to the old city which is a 20 minute walk from our hotel, this is our first experience walking in the traffic of Thailand. As I have described to others the traffic in Thailand is very "organic", drivers very rarely obey all the rules of the road, they frequently ignore lane markings, drive over painted islands, and occasionally treat red lights as stop lights. For us as pedestrians this was terrifying. Despite that and having only a slight idea of where we were going we set out in search of some wats (temples) to visit. We quickly found one of the over 300 wats within Chiang Mai, some are large tourist attractions and others are smaller neighborhood places of worship; we stumbled across the smaller ones first. Not knowing the rules of photography within the temple grounds we decided to avoid taking pictures out of respect but they were absolutely gorgeous.

After a bit more walking around we came across one of the larger temples in the middle of the city and our first potential scam. As soon as we walked through the gate surrounding the temple a man approached us and offered to take us to three other temples in the surrounding area all for only 100 baht (3 dollars for those keeping track at home), he even said he would wait for us outside while we explored. This was already a little sketchy but he then pointed proudly to an unmarked grey car stating it was his; what you have to understand is that much like in North America taxis, tuk-tuks, and [http://www.thaiguidetochiangmai.com/travel-and-transport/songthaew-baht-bus-chiang-mai-transport](songthaews) (pickup trucks converted into a minibus) all have some sort of markings of legitimacy so we politely declined and explored the major temples ourselves.

Some of the temples were fairly small.

Some were much larger, with matching Buddhas.

Others had massive and ancient pagodas, this happens to be the largest one in Chiang Mai.

Right next to the pagoda is a smaller one that is dwarfed by a massive and ancient tree.

Overall it was an amazing first day filled with beautiful sculptures, amazing temples, and tons of history. After the long day in the sun and the several kilometers of walking the first thing we did when we arrived back at the hotel was to collapse into the pool, a great way to end a great day.
