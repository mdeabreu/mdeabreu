Today Emma has been frantically studying for her last two remaining final exams so I have been relaxing, playing some games, browsing the internet, and now writing a blog post to fill you all in on previous adventures.

Emma, two of her friends (Nikita and Katja), and I all decided to go on a little 45 minute drive to John Forrest National Park to go on a little hike, see the sights, and if we were lucky see some kangaroos! If we were successful, this would be my first time seeing kangaroos up close and in the wild; it would be an absolute highlight for me.

Once we arrived we set off into the woods and onto our hike into the wild of Australia. I found this much more interesting, so far we had been in the city for most days; while this has been beautiful and filled with fun, it is just another city like any other. Out here everything was different, there was very little in common with the woods and wilderness of Canada which made it very foreign and interesting. My mom in an email early in my trip asked if I felt I was in a different country, out here I could truthfully answer yes.

After a nice walk in the woods we came to a little bridge over a waterfall, or at least there would be a waterfall if there had been any water. The previous couple of days had been very dry and so there was only a little creek of water running down the rocks, but we used it as a good place to take a little break, enjoy the sun, and a snack. Almost as soon as we sat down the magpies started to land looking for food; they are basically black and white crows with a slightly larger beak.

They were nice company though a little greedy and really wanted any food we had.

Here you can see our group, going left to right we have Katja, Nikita, Emma, and myself.

After crossing the bridge we continued our walk on what I believe was once an old railroad, now it is just a dirt trail with the stereotypical Australian red dirt.

As part of the railroad there was a slightly ominous tunnel that we could walk through; figures, I just took the flashlight out of my backpack this morning... Luckily I had my phone and Nikita had a light of her own.

It was at this point that the trail looped and started heading back and where we saw the first kangaroo!

We took this opportunity to take another little break and once again the magpies found us almost immediately.

By this point in time we had returned to the parking lot where we found a couple more kangaroos hanging around and munching on some plants. We continued on through the parking lot to the tavern where there were supposed to be many kangaroos that we could hand feed.

Sure enough there were kangaroos just waiting to be hand fed, this particular one was so lazy that he just sat there waiting for someone to come up and feed him.

Hiding in the trees were a few rather colourful parrots.

We decided to have a drink and finish off our snacks since the whole walk had been over two hours at this point and we were joined by this pink parrot eating a nut while looking at his reflection.

Overall I would say it was an amazingly successful day and I'm so glad we decided to go yesterday as today has not only been a study day, it has been pouring almost non-stop. I look forward to the many other adventures Emma and I will get up to in Thailand, Cambodia, and Singapore.
