Rebellious Tomato is a local pizza joint here in Vancouver that is sold as an organic and healthy version of pizza that aims to cut down on the unhealthy ingredients normally found in pizza. Their website describes how they use "fresh, organic ingredients" and how their "pizzas represent great taste and good nutrition".

After looking at the menu on their website we decided to try them out, for a place that is organic it's no more or less expensive than any other place (such as Little Caesars, Pizza Hut, etc). We decided to get two large pizzas for $20 each: the Carnivore which comes with ham, capicolli, mushrooms, and mozzarella; and the Margherita which comes with tomatoes, parmesan, basil, and mozzarella. We eagerly awaited their arrival only to be sadly disappointed...

When they arrived we opened the box to find two pizzas that were pathetically thin and barely had any toppings; they were at most 1cm tall, 1.5cm if we're being generous, to give you an idea the standard pizza box is about 5cm tall. In addition to looking rather pathetic the pizzas weren't even cut into slices. The Carnivore which we expected to be covered in meat had maybe 7 pieces of each type of meat and we couldn't even see let alone taste the mushrooms. The Margherita was unfortunately just as bad; there was barely any cheese, the tomatoes were tiny little wedges no bigger than a nickel and the toppings barely even covered the crust. We could see large sections of bread where the tomato sauce was just barely causing the bread to glisten (imagine what the bread looks like when your toppings fall off).

The pizza itself tasted fine, if not a little salty, but for the price I feel it was definitely not worth it. If you're not terribly hungry and are looking to fill up with some organic and healthier pizza Rebellious Tomato is pretty good. However, if you're looking for a big slice of pizza that is absolutely covered in toppings, I unfortunately have to suggest trying somewhere else.
