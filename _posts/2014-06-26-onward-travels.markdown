After all the fun and excitement of the party we spent the entire day of the 23rd packing like crazy to get everything ready for our departure. We did our laundry so we would have clean clothes, we did all the towels, face clothes, sheets, and blankets so they would be clean for Supanee and Sara. We vacuumed, mopped, and packed everything we owned into our bags. There were a few things we decided to throw out (old worn out clothes that would be too hot in Thailand), and a few things we decided to ship back to Canada; we sent the parcel by sea mail which will take around 2-3 months to get to Canada but on the plus side it was only $60. Once everything was packed and ready to go we hopped onto the train where we met up one last time with one of Emma's friends, Katja.

Here you can see our four backpacks which contains everything we will be bring with us into Thailand.

One last look at the view outside our apartment, goodbye Australia.

At the airport the three of us had a last dinner together where we all promised to stay in touch and enjoy our respective holidays. Katja was going on a trip through southern Australia.
It was in the airport that I got rid of my Australian dollars and got my first look at the Thai Baht.

Here you can see 500THB which is equivalent to 16.56CAD, I also had two 1000THB notes in my wallet.

Our trip to Thailand starts with a flight to Singapore, and 8 hour layover in the airport and then a short 4 hour flight up to Chiang Mai. Our flight left Perth at 9:50 at night and we would arrive in Singapore at 3:30 in the morning, so we tried to sleep on the plane and then we found a quiet spot in the Singapore airport to sleep.

The extra sleep we got in the airport was incredibly helpful and we felt so much better; we had enough energy to explore the airport in some detail.

Here you can see us in front of one of the many floral displays. The airport is absolutely gorgeous with more shops and displays than I can count.

They even have a butterfly garden.

As you can see the airport is massive and looks like a mall.

After the layover we had a rather uneventful flight up to Chiang Mai, the only problem was that the plane didn't have any immigration forms and the customs officers were not prepared for this so they quickly ran out. After a short wait everyone was able to get their form and proceed through customs were we found a taxi and proceeded to our hotel.

The weather here is hot and muggy but not terrible, it only ever gets to the low 30s; the first day was brutal but thankfully the hotel had a pool for us to cool off in. We were pretty exhausted so we didn't get up to much but our first full day was amazing, I will tell you all about it in the next post which should be up soon.
