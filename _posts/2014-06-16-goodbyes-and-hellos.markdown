As it is nearing a the end of semester everyone is saying their goodbyes in preparation of heading home, so last night after Emma's roommates finished their last exams they came over and we all had curry cashew lentil burgers which were absolutely delicious. That evening Sara had a plane to catch headed back to North America.

The next day was Supanee's last day in Perth and so we spent the morning cleaning up but also having some fun; Supanee has a cute little bunny by the name of Bunbun.

We spent the morning with Supanee trying to get a picture of Bunbun next to the giant Toblerone to give others a sense of just how big the Toblerone really is.

Then we had a really heartfelt goodbye with Supanee, this was the beginning of many goodbyes.

Then we decided to go up to Cottesloe which is a beach south of Perth and this is exactly what you imagine when you think of a beach in Australia. White sand, blue sky,  bright sun, blue water, and a nice warm breeze; it was absolutely perfect.

After the beach there were plans to meet up with many of the other international and exchange students for a last little party to have some fun at the end of the semester. It was a little odd to me because this is the first time I am meeting many of Emma's friends; so I am saying hello and introducing myself and they are all saying their goodbyes and learning about each others plans for heading back to their homes in various countries. Despite this odd position I was in it was a wonderful night filled with good food, good people, and fun.
