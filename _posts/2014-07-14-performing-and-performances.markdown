One of the highest rated things to do in Pattaya is to visit the Sanctuary of Truth, much like the White temple on the way to Chiang Rai it is a temple that has been created by an artist.

When you first get sight of the temple itself it is like something out of a movie, it's jaw dropping...

The entire temple is made out of wood including all the intricately detailed figures and scenes.

Everything about this place was stunning... The temple itself is only 30 years old however the artist and the many artisans working under him have worked hard to make the temple feel ancient and they have absolutely succeeded at it.

In the grounds surrounding the temple they had a small little theater where twice a day a small show was performed showing Thai dancing and also Thai combat. It was really cool to see the dancing and the staged combat because the performers where having fun and enjoying themselves. During the fight one of the performers hid behind Emma and I while the other said he would throw his sword between us! He then dragged each of us up one at a time and showed us quickly how to fight and got us to fight the other performer! This was absolutely a highlight of our visit to the Sanctuary of Truth.

That evening we went to watch another performance at Tiffany's Show, which is a... well it's a lady-boy show. Pattaya is the lady-boy capital of Thailand. Basically the show is a bunch of men/transvestites dressed in the most amazing and intricate dresses you've ever seen and they dance around stage lip syncing to music. They had little segments portraying many different cultures including Thai, Russian, Italian, Chinese, and Japanese; each one with great music and stunning costumes and set pieces.

For our last full day in Pattaya we decided to head down to Jomtien beach which is just a bit cleaner and also there are fewer people. We enjoyed some time in the sun and walking along the beach with our shoes off, the only downside is that we opted not to swim due to the distance to our hotel which would mean we would have had to spend the rest of the day sandy and salty. Either way it was a great way to spend our last day.

Today we had a very relaxing morning packing before getting into a minibus for a 2 hour trip up to Bangkok. It's amazing how easy and how cheap it is to get around within Thailand! I'm thinking I will write a blog post at the end of my trip with all sorts of tips and tricks so that prospective backpackers will have a bit of an idea what they are getting into.
