<p>We live in a digital age and many of us are looking to secure our digital identity, most of the time this is through registering email addresses or domain names. I was looking to do exactly this but I didn't have the disposable income required to pay for a web host; on top of that most of the web hosts were complete overkill for the simple personal portfolio I wanted to create. For $5 - $10 a month they would give me 100GB of storage, 1TB of bandwidth, 10 MySQL databases and 100 email address. That seems like a great deal but for me that was quite a lot of money and a ton of resources for hosting a simple blog and a personal portfolio, that's when I heard about <a href="http://nearlyfreespeech.net">Nearly Free Speech</a>. With them you pay for what you are actually use, if you're just hosting a simple static page you only have to pay for storage and bandwidth, so if that page is small enough you can go more than a year without paying a cent! For about 7 months I did exactly that, I didn't have to pay a penny and I secured my online identity; I then decided to get myself a domain name (which NSFN will offer you) and set up a blog. So I enabled PHP and MySQL (which charge an extra cent or two a day) and installed Wordpress; all of this was done in only a few minutes. For a simple little site like mine, <a href="http://nearlyfreespeech.net">Nearly Free Speech</a> is an amazing choice because of just how cheap it is and on top of that I have never had a problem with them. So if you're looking to secure your online identity or just need a place to host a small site, take a look at Nearly Free Speech, you might like what you see.</p>
