After the great success of the tour to Doi Inthanon we decided to book another tour they offered to the city of Chiang Rai to the north. This would be a longer tour with more driving but we would be able to see the White Temple and the Golden Triangle among other stops.

The White Temple is actually privately funded by an artist of Chiang Rai rather than by the government, as a result he was able to exercise his own artistic visions during it's creation. The temple and surrounding grounds are amazing however you will have to click the read more button at the bottom of the post if you would like to see them. **If you ever plan on visiting this temple don't spoil it! Wait until you arrive to see the grounds.**

And now back to our regularly scheduled program, further north from Chiang Rai is what's known as The Golden Triangle.

As you can see The Golden Triangle is where the three countries of Thailand, Laos, and Myanmar all meet.

Here you can see the three countries and the two rivers separating them. I am standing in Thailand looking north so it is at the bottom, Laos is to the left, and Myanmar is on the right.

Overall it was a long day filled a lot of driving but it was absolutely worth it. I will continue with a few more pictures of the White Temple, **don't look if you want to visit** I thought the surprise was really cool.

I don't know what it means, but yes that's a bottle of whiskey on a skull.

From a distance the temple looks gorgeous and is a brilliant white, especially in the sun; as you get closer you start to see details like this.

To enter the temple you have to walk over that bridge, not creepy in the slightest.

Visiting the temple and having no idea what to expect made it that much more interesting, there was an air of creepiness but also a lot of beauty.
