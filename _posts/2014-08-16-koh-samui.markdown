After the many temples both in Thailand and in Cambodia we were starting to get a little tired of looking at ruins, luckily for us this part of the trip contained absolutely no temples! The rest of our trip would be nice and relaxing, and Koh Samui would be the perfect place to do exactly that. The entire island is basically one big beach resort.

We didn't really take that many photos because as beautiful as it was, we were too busy relaxing and enjoying the sun. I unfortunately did have a bout of food poisoning for the first two days but after that we got to relax on the beach, go swimming and we even took a snorkeling tour to another island with tons of coral and fish! A perfect way to bring our adventure to a close.
