Yesterday I mentioned that on our first day we were potentially scammed but we decided to take some potentially good information from it. The man had pointed out several different temples and places he would bring us, so we looked them up online and decided to visit on and the nearby national museum.

As you can see areas of this temple are ancient... But still very active, as we were started to make our way back we noticed a large gathering of people all preparing to give donations to Buddha and worship. It was very interesting to see the culture come alive in front of us.

After the museum and temple we headed back to the hotel to rest and relax for a little bit before heading out in the evening to catch the night market. On our way there we bumped into some locals who just started talking to us, they were so nice and gave us a few tip of different places to go and what to avoid. Everyone here is extremely nice and very polite; the whole town feels very laid back.

We roamed around the night market and then we grabbed some dinner and headed back to the hotel, it was at this point that we had decided we wanted to stay in Chiang Mai a little longer. When we first set out our plans we knew we would be in Chiang Mai for a while and then we would slowly make our way south on the train system eventually making it to Pattaya. All together we had 8 days unaccounted for, but we received some recommendations for Hua Hin; so we made the decision to stay a little longer, take an overnight train to Hua Hin, and stay there before heading on to Pattaya.
