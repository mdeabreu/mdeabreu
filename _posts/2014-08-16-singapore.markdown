Our final stop on our trip before starting the long journey home. I have described Singapore as surreal and I think that describes it perfectly; in the picture above you can see three massive buildings of a hotel. Each one is 53 stories tall with who knows how many rooms for guests; on top of the three buildings is a boat. Yes you read that correctly, that's supposed to be a boat. Inside the boat is a bar, a restaurant, and a lookout over the city.

Next to the hotel are the Gardens by the Bay, inside are these massive super trees that are covered in small bushes and shrubs. Within the trees are man-made equipment that help to clean up the air within Singapore.

It is an amazing experience to walk around the city and see some of the massive structures that have been made, and makes me think back about the rest of our trip. We have gone from looking at the ruins of ancient civilizations to some of the most impressive structures built by our civilization. In a hundred, thousand, or ten thousand years when our civilization has collapsed, what will people think when they see the ruins of our buildings. What will they think when they see these super trees over grown by plants and vines due to neglect from caretakers that have long since disappeared...

What kind of a legacy are we leaving to the many civilizations that will come after us?
