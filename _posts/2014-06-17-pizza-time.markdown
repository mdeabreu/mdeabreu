Despite a day filled with studying, blog posting, cleaning, and doing chores; we still found time to make an amazing dinner for ourselves. Not to mention this cleaned out a lot of the fridge so we won't have to worry about anything going bad for the two weeks no one is in the apartment.

Here you can see our amazing pizza before we cook it; we have tomatoes, green bell peppers (or as the Aussies say capsicum), mushrooms, spinach, basil, and cheese (provolone, emmental, mozzarella).

We're so tempted to take it out right now... but we must resist.

As I said, we eat really well here. Bon app√©tit!
