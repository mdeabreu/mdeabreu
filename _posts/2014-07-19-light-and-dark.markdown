So as I said previously we have arrived in Bangkok, our hostel is quite a ways out of the downtown core but thankfully is only an 8 minute walk to the BTS (skytrain) station from which we can get just about anywhere. One area of Bangkok has quite a few temples and so we decided to head to that part of the city and work our way from one temple to the next taking as many photos as we could. In theory this sounded like a great idea but the day turned sour fast. The map we had was not to scale, so what we thought would be a short walk turned out to be much longer... As we were walking we bumped into a random local who started talking to us and asked if we had a map, so we took ours out and he quickly started writing on it showing us different places that would be nice to visit and that we were unlucky because the temples were closed for a Buddhist holiday. One thing he was very quick to recommend was a one hour long tailed boat tour; we had heard of this tour but we weren't keen on doing it (it was 1 or 2 thousand baht which we didn't want to spend). While we were thanking him for the advice he even went onto the street and hailed a tuktuk to take us to the pier to get on the boat tour. We thanked both him and the driver but declined and continued walking.

With the information that the temples were closed we quickly changed our plans to head to another pier where we could catch ferries up and down the river with the idea of heading further north to the national museum. At the pier we were trying to figure out how much the ferry would cost another local started talking to us again asking for our map. Being the polite Canadians we were we didn't want to be rude so we let him recommend places to go as he drew on our map, he was even kind enough to suggest the long tailed boat tour! Luckily he didn't wave down a tuktuk so we thanked him for the advice and left the pier to avoid any confrontation under the guise of heading to one of the locations he recommended.

We continued on to the next pier where we were finally able to catch our ferry and continue with our original plan. Once we got to near the national museum we noticed a temple beside it, as we were looking around a woman motions for us to enter as if to say it is open, so we head on in and start slowly looking around. She comes up to us again and starts talking to us showing us a bit of the temple. She then also asks for our maps and points out some locations including... you guessed it! The long tailed boat tour! She, like the first man, flagged down a tuktuk and said since we now have a Thai friend the tuktuk driver with give us the Thai price and that when we get to the pier we should as for the Thai price as well (only 1200B instead of 2000B). We were getting a little frustrated but we didn't want to offend so we tried various excuses to not get into that tuktuk. We needed to find a 7-11 to buy water, she showed us a little vendor selling drinks; so we bought water... Then we said we needed to visit an ATM, she said the tuktuk driver will stop by one. We said we wanted to check out the national museum, she said it was closed. So we got in the tuktuk...

Sure enough he took us to an ATM and then to the pier, when we got out we were quickly met by the boat tour salesman offering a wonderful deal of 2400B for the two of us. We told him we'll catch the next sailing, he said I'll give you the tour for 1800B! We were tired and now getting pissed so we just said no, we'll come back later. This of course was a lie but we were done; basically our whole day was ruined we didn't get to see any temples, we had been scammed by 3 different people from 3 completely different walks of life and to top it all off we were basically back where we started right next to the BTS station we got off at...

Feeling completely defeated we went to another BTS station where they happened to have the largest mall in Asia, and thankfully this is where our day started to pick up. We had dinner at a nice restaurant looking out over the city while we listened to live music. Not wanting to head back to the hostel too early we decided to see a movie, on our way to the movie theater (in the mall mind you) we say a candy shop where they were making all their hard candy by hand and we got to watch the entire process.

I managed to record the whole process of them making this candy so I'll upload it to YouTube so you can watch it.

Once we got to the theater we noticed that the movie we wanted to watch was only playing in the Happy World theater which was 250B per person. We decided why not and bought them, not entirely sure what to expect. It turns out it was entirely worth it! With each ticket we got 100B worth of food (enough for a popcorn and a pop)  and inside the theater each person got a lazy boy recliner with a blanket, because of this there were only about 50 seats in total. So to reiterate: we got free food, a comfy recliner, a blanket, and very few other people in the theater; it was awesome! Oh, and all of this for two people was less than a normal movie ticket in Canada.

At the end of the day we realized that some people just want to scam you to try to get a little extra money, and while this sucks it shouldn't ruin your day. We have since found better ways of dealing with them but we have also learned that we need to take the bad with the good. On this particular day we had a terrible start but it got better, it's all about finding the light in the darkness.
