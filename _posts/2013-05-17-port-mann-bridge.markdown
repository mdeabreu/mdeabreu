I recently got the chance to drive across the new Port Mann Bridge in Surrey, BC. This is a new and very beautiful bridge that has replaced an older, narrower crossing. The idea, of course, is to reduce traffic jams; the slight downside is now this is a toll bridge. However, this is what's called an "open road" toll bridge; basically there are no stereotypical toll booths that cause traffic to slow to a crawl. To pay the toll you can register your car and receive a small RFID sticker that will communicate with a transceiver in the bridge which will charge your account. If you don't register (you infrequently cross or are from out of town) one of two things can happen. You either go online and pay the toll using your credit card or after seven days an invoice will be mailed to you which you can then pay in a variety of ways.

Every time you cross the bridge a camera takes a picture of your license plate which you use to pay your toll online. After the seven days, that information is used to get your home address and mail the invoice to you (along with a processing fee). All in all it's a very cool way to increase traffic flow and still be able to charge drivers a toll. The only problem is that there was almost no indication that you can pay online and bypass the processing fee (which almost doubles the toll) and so visitors are much more likely to get charged the processing fee. I know construction isn't complete and I'm sure there are plans to put up signs that will help everyone understand all the different ways to pay the toll. Until that happens they need to put up a temporary sign, even something as simple as "Pay your toll at treo.ca".
