Yesterday was the first time we took a preplanned tour, we booked a tour up to the highest point in Thailand known a Doi Inthanon. We booked the tour though tourist information booth where the owner helped point us toward various temples and points of interest on the first day, we was extremely kind and helpful so we trusted his recommendation of a travel company.

The day of the tour while waiting to be picked up at our hotel I looked up the company running the tour, Journey Tours, on TripAvisor; the reviews were... mixed... This didn't instill me with a lot of confidence however any worries I had were quickly forgotten, there were eight other people joining us for the tour and our tour guide turned out to be really nice and gladly shared all sorts of information with us about all the sights we saw.

It was about a 45 minute drive out of the city followed by a half hour drive up the winding road until we reached the top with a monument to a king who had helped to preserve large plots of land as nature reserves.

Here you can see the monument and the many offerings. You can also see that we are high enough to be in the clouds which made it a little cold and wet but not too bad, the only downside was that we were unable to experience some of the fantastic views.

We continued on to twin temples made for the king and queen, they loomed over us in the grey of the clouds.

We continued onto the royal project where the current king has gotten rid of the growing of poppy's for opium and instead replaced it with the growing of fruits and vegetables for the city of Chiang Mai.

We then continued onto two different waterfalls before heading back into the city, we got dropped off early to go see the Saturday market but we were far more tired than we had thought and so we quickly decided to head back to the hotel room for some well needed rest.
