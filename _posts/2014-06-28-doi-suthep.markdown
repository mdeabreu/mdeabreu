On our third day we made our way into the old city to grab some Thai Milk Tea from a coffee shop we found on our first day, Emma is absolutely addicted to the drink and I have to say it's really good! On our way out of the city we went to a specific gate over the moat where many songthaews gather to take tourists up a nearby mountain to Doi Suthep. It was on our way to the gate that we saw our first evidence of the military coup that took place in May. In the news in North America you hear how it is military everywhere, how people shouldn't visit Thailand, and how it is extremely dangerous; I can safely say (at least in Chiang Mai) this is completely false. We say one soldier outside the arts museum leaning on a riot shield looking hot and bored but very relaxed. A bit further on at the gate over the moat we found it was closed off with a small squad of soldiers, all sitting around smoking, playing cards or looking at their phones.

This is the pagoda in the temple at the top of Doi Suthep, this is one of the most important temples in Chiang Mai and it shows. The temple was extraordinary with many people praying and worshiping, while there we got blessed by a monk which was a really interesting experience.

We decided that today was going to be a fairly relaxing day so after a few laps we went for a Thai massage which felt so good after all the walking we've been doing.
