It's been a while since my last blog post and I apologize for that, I've been sending emails to my family to keep them up to date but I've fallen behind on my blog posting. So I will be revisiting previous locations and telling you all about them, first up: The Royal Palace and The Emerald Buddha.

On one of our previous days in Bangkok we had attempted to visit several of the temples including the Grad Palace but we kept getting pulled aside and told that the temples were closed and we should go on a long tail boat tour. We decided tat on this day no matter what anyone said we were going to make it to the temples and see them for ourselves, our trip there was uneventful and we actually had quite a nice time. We started by going to a temple opposite the palace, Wat Pho, where they had an absolutely massive Buddha statue. It was easily the biggest statue we had seen to date.

As you can see the Buddha is quite massive! They even had all the little gifts that had been donated to the temple by visiting foreign dignitaries including a signed letter from President Obama.

After lunch we made our way to the Royal Palace and the temple within the grounds, here you can see one of the main buildings in the temple that houses the Emerald Buddha. It was originally called the white Buddha because it had a covering hiding the material beneath, when the outer layer was cracked and damaged they were able to see the jade underneath and renamed it the Emerald Buddha. Now it sits in the building and a few times a year the king of Thailand will come and change the outfit to show all the current season of the year.

After the temple there were some portions of the Royal Palace that were open to the public along with a textile museum showing some of the outfits the queen has worn and all the work she is doing to help the silk industry in Thailand.

The only downside to this day was that there was a bit of a downpour while we were walking around outside but even that had some entertainment value. Much like Buckingham Palace there are guards outside the Royal Palace, both of them were standing on pedestals and completely without warning the got off them and marched into a little alcove. The second the guards got into the alcove it started pouring! As we walked by them we gave them a little knowing look as all the other tourists ran to find cover, one of the guards noticed our look and gave us a little smile causing us to start laughing and him to smile even more. Just thinking about it puts a smile on my face.
