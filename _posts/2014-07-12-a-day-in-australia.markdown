Yesterday was my first full day being in Australia, I am still jet lagged and on a weird sleep schedule so I ended up waking up at 4:30 in the morning, but once Emma was up we began our day. She still has exams so studying is her first priority, we went up to Murdoch taking the train for the short 5 minute trip to the Murdoch station. Once there we decided to walk in the sun and take a little tour of the campus which is absolutely gorgeous.

Throughout Cockburn, many new buildings are going up with a very modern style of architecture, I will have to get a couple more shots of the apartment we are staying in and some of the new buildings going up. After letting Emma get some solid work done studying we met up with her friend and roommate Sara to go have lunch in the small nearby town of Fremantle.

As you can see it has that small town feeling with some beautiful architecture, and on top of that it was my first time seeing wild parrots!

The park was filled with them!

While there we quickly stopped at a Target to pick up something for Emma's other roommate, Supani.

Yes, you are seeing that correctly. It's a 3 foot long Toblerone called at "Toblerone & on & on & on & on & on & on & ..."; while carrying it we had many strange looks, but it was a conversation starter!

After Fremantle we went to a large mall to pick up some essential supplies and just generally to be mall rats. As Emma pointed out it was exactly the same as any other mall in North America, it looked the same and had all the same stuff, the only difference was that there was very little overlap in the brands.

Then we headed home for a relaxing evening and a futile attempt at keeping me awake to continue transitioning to the new timezone.
